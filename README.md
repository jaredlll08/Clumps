# Clumps

Clumps groups XP orbs together into a single entity to reduce lag when there are many in a small area. Ontop of this, it also makes the player immediately collect the orbs once they touch the player, so you are not stuck with a bunch of orbs in your face.

## Do I have to install it client or server side?

- For **1.17 or newer versions** it is only required on **server side**.
- For **older minecraft versions** you have to install it on **both sides**.
